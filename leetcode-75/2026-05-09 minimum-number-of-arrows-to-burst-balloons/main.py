from typing import List

# Approach: Greedy sorting by end coordinate to reuse arrows
# Time Complexity: O(n log n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
# Edge Cases: All overlapping balloons, no overlapping balloons

class Solution:
    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        points.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

        arrows = 1
        end = points[0][1]

        for start, finish in points[1:]:
            if start > end:
                arrows += 1
                end = finish

        return arrows
